==Abstract==

An Javascript API is proposed for dApps development. This API allows dApps to communicate with Ontology blockchain and make requests for transfers, ONT ID registration and others without requiring users to trust the dApp itself. The trust issue is shifted to the API implementation provider.

==Motivation==

Currently a dApp will use one of the SDKs (Typescript, Java, Python, ...) to communicate with Ontology network. This setup has two main disadvantages:

1. User of the dApp will have to trust with his private keys to the dApp developer and that information about transfers mediated through the dApp are legitimate.

2. Although the SDKs are very powerful, they are hard to use. A more streamlined API will allow developers to focus on the application itself.
